# Smart contract for one-zero

## Contracts

- Factory
- Long token
- Short token

## How it works

- Factory creates markets
- Make an offer at the market
- When offer is accepted (share pair is matched), long tokens and short tokens are distributed based on position
- One can sell these tokens to others
- When market closes, tokens related to that market get paid out/burned depending on the market resolution
