# Smart contracts for one-zero

## Smart contracts

- Factory
- Token
- MarketMaker

## How it works

- Factory creates markets
- Make an offer at the market
- When offer is accepted (share pair is matched), long tokens and short tokens are distributed based on position
- One can sell these tokens to others
- When market closes, token owners can interact with the factory to resolve their tokens
- Tokens related to that market get paid out/burned depending on the market resolution
